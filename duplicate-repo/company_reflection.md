**Why do you think Focus Bear was created?**

Focus Bear was created to help people who have trouble staying focused on important tasks and easily get distracted to overcome their problems. It does this by blocking the unnecessary apps selected by the user so that they cannot be accessed during focus periods. Additionally, it reminds users to partake in healthy habits, such as breathing exercises, drinking water, stretching, etc.

**What problem is Focus Bear solving?**

It aims to promote time management and productivity among people with ADHD who struggle to stay focused to the point where it significantly affects their quality of life. It also enforces morning and evening routines and regular breaks to provide structure to the user's routine and reduce distractions.

**Why do you think this mission is important?**

This mission is important because structure and routine are necessary for living a healthy and balanced life. By helping users stay productive and build healthier habits, Focus Bear resultantly empowers them to reach their goals, gain more control over their lives, and improve their quality of life as a whole.

**How does Focus Bearâ€™s work align with your personal values or interests?**

I personally struggle to stay focused, especially as of lately. With having to balance 2 internships, a full time study load, learning plans outside of work and university, applying for jobs, preparing for interviews, and still having enough time in the day to cook for myself, keep my room clean and meet fitness goals, I am going through a very hectic period in my life where I have zero time for hobbies or social life. It is a reality that I have to come to terms with during this last few coming months of my studies, and I greatly appreciate Focus Bear's blocking feature which helps me stay disciplined, not only during focus periods, but also during chores, when getting out of bed, or when I am exhausted and craving for dopamine. I would lose entire days to procrastinating from exhaustion and burnout, but with Focus Bear, I have been able to cut down on all the distractions and stay focused on my learning journey to achieve my goals without working myself to the bone by following the pomodoro method with the help of the app.

**Do you personally relate to any of the challenges that Focus Bear aims to solve?**

Yes, I struggle to stay focused on the more mundane but still important tasks for even for 15 minutes, I crave for gratification that I get from for example learning new skills, watching sports, etc. The blocking feature of the app has been of great help, and has helped me become more productive throughout my days.
