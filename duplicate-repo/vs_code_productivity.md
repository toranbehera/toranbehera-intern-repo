## Which shortcuts do you think will be the most useful in your daily work?

The shortcuts that I use the most are f5, ctrl + \`, and ctrl + shift \`. Other commands that could be useful to me are ctrl + shift + l (since I use the 'change multiple occurences' feature frequently) and alt left/right, as it navigates between previous cursor positions and effectively edits conveniently, even between closed editors, which can aid me in trackings mistypes that I recall making.

## How can keyboard shortcuts improve your productivity?

Each use of a keyboard short cut saves me several seconds worth of of time that I would have otherwise spent using the graphical alternative. Over the course of maybe a 5 hour work period, if I make edits of this nature purely relying on keyboard shortcuts, the cumulative time that I would have otherwise taken by moving my mouse around the GUI for those minor tasks would be comparatively much lesser, adding up to potentially an hour worth of time being saved.
