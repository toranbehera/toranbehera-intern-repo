## Have you used Git before?Â If so, in what context?
I have used Git before for a unit called Mobile App Development, where I was required to submit my source code alongside a structured commit history. I only used it to a basic level, with a few commands, such as clone, add, pull, commit, and push. 

## Which Git client (if any) did you choose? Why?
I used Android Studio's version control GUI, as it was easy to locate with the IDE's interface, making it the obvious choice at that time for me. I was also new to git at that time, so I was nervous about using the terminal.

However, after encountering a few bugs, and committing a few errors due to my lack of knowledge of git, I decided to switch to using the terminal, as I could run git help to check what it command does, and because most of the learning resources that I found taught how to use git through the terminal.

## What was the most interesting thing you learned about Git today?
I learned about git stash, which lets developers remove their uncommitted changes to their code and recover them later. This is useful in cases where I have made some changes to a branch, and along the way, realized that it is better to put those changes in a separate new branch; I can conveniently run git stash, create and move to a new branch, then run git stash pop to bring those changes over to the new branch.
