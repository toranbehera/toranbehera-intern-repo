The location will always be in the **new Latelab on Swinburne Hawthorn campus, level 2.**

*Note*
- The general idea is to commit 2 hours every weekday, so 2 hours x 5 weekdays = **10 hours per week.**

- If progress is deemed unsatisfactory by myself or the supervisor, I will commit more time on Saturday afternoon till evening.
