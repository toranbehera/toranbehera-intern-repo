## Reflection

**How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?**

Kanban does this by providing a shared visual board to a team with backlog, in progress, and completed tasks columns that the user can drag different tasks across according to their status for everyone to view at al times. Additionally, these tasks can be given different priorities in the form of colored labels ranging from green to red according to increasing priority. Moreover, each tasks can be assigned a due date/deadline, and their deadline indicator's color changes to yellow, orange and red according to how close the deadline for that task is. These features can help teams manage priorities.

Kanban helps avoid overload by setting WIP(work in progress) limits, which is how many tasks can be in a given column. For example, no more than 3 tasks in the In Progress column is a WIP limit. This prevents teams from assigning themselves too many tasks in a single period of time, and the capped number of tasks in the In Progress column have to be completed before more tasks can be allocated.

**How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?**

I can improve my workflow using Kanban principles by:
- moving task cards allocated to me across columns according to their status
- taking note of blocked work and clearing them as soon as possible so that new tasks can be added to the In Progress column
- preventing overloading myself with too much tasks without knowing with the help of the WIP limit
## Task

**Check out Focus Bear’s Kanban board and note how tasks are structured. _(Hint: Look in GitHub Projects.)_ & Move at least one task through the Kanban process and update its status correctly.**

**Identify one way you can improve task tracking in your role.**

  I can use the kanban board and update my tasks status more frequently by dragging to different columns, leaving comments, and adding more details my tasks as I feel right in the form of checklists or notes.
