## Research & Learn

- [x] Who are considered vulnerable populations, and what challenges might they face in digital spaces?

- [x] What ethical considerations are important when designing or working with neurodivergent individuals? (Hint: Avoid overwhelming UX, respect sensory needs, ensure clear communication.)

- [x] How can you make interactions and content more accessible for people with ADHD or Autism? (e.g., simple language, predictable navigation, reducing cognitive load)

- [x] How can we support neurodivergent team members in a professional setting? (Hint: Be clear in communication, respect different working styles, and allow flexibility.)

## Reflection 

**How can you adjust your communication style to be more inclusive of neurodivergent users and teammates?**

I can be more inclusive by avoiding jargons as much as possible in my communication and frequently involving teammates by giving them a chance to speak or asking them to share their ideas and thoughts when they seem to be disappearing from the discussion.  

**What are some common UX or communication pitfalls that might make Focus Bear less accessible or supportive?**

- Using unclear language/expressions or words that certain populations that don't speak English as their first language might struggle with
- Not using icons that clearly convey the purpose of certain buttons or clickable areas 
- (Over)using flashy colors and animations 
- Not giving the user flexibility over simple sensory elements, such as dark/light mode, control over sound effects
- Having long user flows 

**What is one practical change you can make in your work to better support vulnerable populations?**

- Use visuals such as flowcharts to convey my ideas better, especially when suggesting new features
- Prioritising communicating clearly over delivering my ideas fast
- Break large tasks into smaller, more manageable loads, organised as bullet points
- Taking notes to summarise important discussions so that other teammates can refer to them in case they forget certain points or if it escaped their attention during the meeting

## Task

- [x] Read a **first-person account** from someone with ADHD or Autism about their experiences with productivity tools. _(Hint: Look for blog posts, videos, or community discussions.)_

- Several tools such as Notion, To-Doist, and iCalendar were discussed
- The writer uses them to set agendas
- They mentioned experiencing fatigue from customising highly customizable options such as Notion out of impulse
- Eventually, they would get bored and forget to use the app

- Instead of Notion, the writer decided to stick with To-Doist, iCalendar, and OneNote
- Repliers responded affirmatively towards getting hooked onto the customisability of certain apps

- Media-consumer101 mentioned that they enjoy using Google Calendar and Tasks as they transfer unfinished tasks to the next day until the user ticks them off
- Media-consumer101 likes to keep task descriptions as short as possible otherwise they never get them done
- They also figured that they prefer putting all tasks in a single to-do list page instead of having separate pages for each category of tasks, else, by their words 'I'll forget that I have a job or a life'

- wafflehousewife69 enjoys using Planner Pad as it lets them organise and pinpoint tasks according to their level of urgency
- 
- Peppermint_Sonata uses an Excel spreadsheet to organise their tasks as it does not grant them a lot of customisability, which mitigates the problem of getting sucked into over-customising the tool of choice

- [x] Identify **one design or communication improvement** that could make Focus Bear more accessible.

- When a user sets the app up, the app should also take into consideration whether the user is a student or a working professional and suggest habit routines accordingly. Habits tend to vary between the two categories, e.g. a student may frequently visit campus to study outdoors, while, for example a software dev that works from home may live more sedentarily. That way, more meaningful habits can be suggested.

- The embedded video, especially the breathing process video during the onboarding steps, should start playing by themselves as soon as the counter begins. Otherwise, as the timer starts instantly whether the video is played or not, the screen closes and the video ends abruptly as the user is following it, compromising user experience.

- The home/habits page should display the amount of free time left 

- Let the user quickly check off a habit that they completed outside of the app's activity. Currently, for every activity, the user has to click on it, get directed to the timed activity screen, and then click 'skip habit'.

- [x] Practice writing **a clear, patient, and supportive response** to a hypothetical user struggling with executive functioning.

I understand that you feel overwhelmed with trying to manage your long list of tasks for the day. Let's try to break them down into smaller, easier steps, I promise they become much easier to work through after this! Let's pick one task that you want to focus on now. Now, let's divide them into smaller steps: do you need to download and understand a new application first? Do you need to carry out some background research on a topic relating to the task? Let's pick one of them, set a timer for 25 minutes, and stay focused on it until the timer runs out. We will take a short break after that, maybe celebrate with some snacks or a short video! Remember, these 25 minutes are not supposed to be a race, so work at your own pace. It is okay to take your time; it is the progress that you make that really matters.
