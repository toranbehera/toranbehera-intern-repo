**Which AI tools did you try?**

I tried Github Copilot, ChatGPT, and Claude AI.

**What worked well? What didnâ€™t?**

I enjoy how copilot's autocomplete capabilities and its quick fix feature. I also like that I can prompt it to write boilerplate for me so that I can write the full logic later.

What I didn't like was when I asked copilot to write boilerplate for some presumably simpler functions, it attempted to write the logic as well, and incorrectly so for my case. 

**When do you think AI is most useful for coding?**

When completing tedious manual tasks such as writing boilerplates or brushing up comments. It is also helpful when you need advice on how to resolve a bug and are running out of ideas. However, in that case, AI should be used to point you towards possible causes for you to look further into, not be used to directly fix the bug.

**Experimenting**
I can use Claude Sonnet through copilot to generate boilerplate for path operation functions for the CRUD operations of a simple to-do list app.
