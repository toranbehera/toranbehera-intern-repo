**What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?**

**Freedom**

Freedom focuses on only blocking apps across devices, but lacks the habit building and guided routines features of Focus Bear. Focus not only blocks apps like Freedom does, but also helps users actively build better habits.

**Cold Turkey**

Cold Turkey is very rigid with its app blocking sessions; once the timer starts, you cannot turn it off until it ends. Focus Bear gives the user more flexibility over this feature; if the user wants, they can pause the timer or end a focus session whenever they want to, or if they prefer more strictness, they could start a focus session with 'super strict mode' enabled.

**Tiimo**

The main appeal of Tiimo is its visual scheduling and routines. However, it lacks the preset habit routines of Focus Bear. While Tiimo is geared to help neurodiverse users build plans, Focus Bear aims to help users develop healthy habits on top of scheduling tasks.

**Routinery**

Routinery is geared towards helping users build daily routines by implementing habit timers and stacking, similar to Focus Bear. However, Focus Bear goes further by blocking distractions as well, on top of guiding users through routines.

**If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?**

I would choose Focus Bear for its flexible distractions blocking feature, task scheduling, and its emphasis on building healthy habits. Other apps do not incorporate all of these together.

**What’s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?**

Tiimo has a visual daily planner with tasks can be scheduled via dragging and dropping. Freedom and Cold Turkey also sync their blocking feature in both phone and desktop; if blocking is enabled on either device, it automatically becomes enabled in the other device as well. Routinery also allows users to quickly navigate to the next/previous task in their healthy habits routine with a next button, while Focus Bear only allows pausing.

**Based on your research, what’s one improvement you think Focus Bear could make**?

Freedom and Cold Turkey also sync their blocking feature in both phone and desktop; if blocking is enabled on either device, it automatically becomes enabled in the other device as well. This is a feature that could improve Focus Bear, while also giving the user flexibility of enabling/disabling the syncing.
