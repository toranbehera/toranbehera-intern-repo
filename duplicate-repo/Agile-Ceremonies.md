## Research & Learn

- What are the main **Agile ceremonies**, and what is their purpose?
    
    - **Daily Stand-ups**
	    - Short daily meetings where team members share progress, future plans, and blockers related to their daily work 
        
    - **Sprint Planning (Scrum) vs. Continuous Prioritization (Kanban)**
	    - Sprint planning is conducted at the start of each sprint, and it involved the team developing a set of backlog items to deliver by the end of each sprint
	    - Kanban involves pulling tasks from the backlog, performing, them, and then dragging them to the 'finished tasks' column once completed in a visual board
        
    - **Retrospectives**
	    - held at the end of a sprint, it helps teams reflect on what went well, what did not, and how improvements can be made to certain processes and collaboration to yield better outcomes
        
    - **Backlog Refinement**
        - involves reviewing, prioritising, and estimating effort for backlog items to ensure clarity and readiness for the next sprint(s)
    

How do Agile teams collaborate asynchronously and across time zones?
- Collaboration tools like Jira or Trello are used to manage task backlogs and track everyone's progress, allowing teammates to update and modify tasks anytime in a shared space for everyone to see and stay updated
- Communication platforms like Microsoft Teams and Discord allow all members to meet from the comfort of their homes in their own time zones and message each other, in group chats, reducing reliance on real-time meetings
- Shared documentation tools such as Notion make sure that all updated information is accessible to all workers
## Reflection

- How do Agile ceremonies help with **communication and alignment**?
	Agile ceremonies improve communication and alignment by:
	- promoting transparency through daily stand-ups
	- keeping track of tasks (backlog) in a shared visual board
	- promoting clarity in the team by carrying out reflective ceremonies such as retrospectives and backlog refinement that are geared towards better understanding the tasks that were performed to see what can be improved and coming up with a set of tasks for the next sprint
    
- Which ceremony do you think is **most important for your role**, and why?
	As a mobile app developer, I would expect to be involved in keeping notes of the client's requirements, discussing the business logic of the features that I am expected to develop, and getting feedback. Hence, daily stand-ups would be the most important ceremony for my role as it would let me regularly collect feedback for my work in terms of how well I have captured the client's requirements and make improvements regularly in a structured manner, maximising the quality of my output. 

## Task

**Attend a stand-up meeting and observe how updates are shared.**

Everyone took turns to speak and shared what they have done so far, what they are planning to do next, and what issues they faced along with any relevant queries.

**Participate in a retrospective or review past notes from one.**

**Document one change you can make to improve your team collaboration.**

I should be more concise in how I share my updates.
