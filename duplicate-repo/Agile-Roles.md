## Reflection

**What is your role, and how does it contribute to the Agile process?**

I am a developer, and my job is to help build the product by writing code to implement features, fix bugs, enhance existing features, etc. I contribute to the Agile process by pulling tasks into the In Progress column when the WIP limit allows it, committing new sets of stories/tasks for the sprint, and working towards completing the sprint backlog. As a result, I should deliver good quality increments of working software every sprint.

**How do your responsibilities overlap or interact with other roles in the team?**

My responsibilities overlap/interact with other roles as described:
- *QA testers*
	- I have to communicate with QA testers to create test cases (ideally before starting to code) and evaluate the validity of the results of the tests
- *Product manager*
	- I have to discuss and clarify the product's requirements with the PM before starting to build it
	- I have to communicate what can be built and within what timeframe, the complexity of the requirements, any costs that will incur, brainstorm how the product can be improved, etc.
	- Product manager will also give feedback on whatever work has been completed and how well we have captured their requirements, and make revisions according to the feedback
- *Project manager*
	- I have to communicate any blockers to the project manager so that they can aid in removing them (e.g., by reducing the WIP limit)
	- I should also suggest any other improvements that could be made to the current process in retrospectives
- *UX/UI designers*
	- I can aid designers by providing them feedback on their designs in terms of feasibility in terms of not only difficulty of implementation, but performance as well
## Task

**Write a short description of how your role fits into the Agile team.**

I am a developer, and my job is to help build the product by writing code to implement features, fix bugs, enhance existing features, etc. I contribute to the Agile process by pulling tasks into the In Progress column when the WIP limit allows it, committing new sets of stories/tasks for the sprint, and working towards completing the sprint backlog. As a result, I should deliver good quality increments of working software every sprint.

Identify one **other role** you frequently collaborate with and describe how you can improve teamwork with them.

- *Product manager*
	- I have to discuss and clarify the product's requirements with the PM before starting to build it
	- I have to communicate what can be built and within what timeframe, the complexity of the requirements, any costs that will incur, brainstorm how the product can be improved, etc.
	- Product manager will also give feedback on whatever work has been completed and how well we have captured their requirements, and make revisions according to the feedback

Improvement: I can improve teamwork with them by being proactive in my work so that I will have meaningful updates or findings to share every meeting that gives us both more insight into how we can improve the product, minimise costs, what infrastructure (e.g. services, stack, APIs) will be needed, etc.
