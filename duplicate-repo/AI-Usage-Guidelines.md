## Research and Learn

**What AI tools are typically used for your role?**

- Copilot - built-in extension in VS Code that can write boilerplate for me, gives enhanced autocomplete capabilities, suggest improvements, and make quick fixes to small errors or oversights in my code, e.g. missing semi-colons or braces, missing imports, etc.

- ChatGPT - chatbot that can be prompted for various cases, e.g. systems design-related advice, understanding code, learning new tools and concepts, etc.

- Cursor - enhanced AI tool similar to Copilot, but operates with an AI first approach: the AI works as the brain behind your code instead of as an assistant

**What are the benefits and risks of using AI in a professional setting?**

- Benefits
	- speeds up the developer's workflow
	- helps developer tackle new problems or situations where they could be unsure about how they could approach it
	- can suggest improvements for optimizing code
- Risks
	- information provided by AI could be outdated
	- Over-reliance can lead to a lack of development in the developer's own ability
	- Security vulnerabilities or performance bottlenecks could arise if every suggestion from AI is followed blindly

**What types of information should never be entered into AI tools?**

Sensitive information such as passwords, credit card information, health records, API keys, internal workplace secrets, legal documents, private information that can be used for blackmailing; do not share anything that you would not share with a stranger.

**How can you fact-check and validate AI-generated content to ensure accuracy?**

When it comes to writing code, I personally find it best to not rely on AI at all. However, if need be, I will always ask AI to explain the lines that I do not understand or check through the official documentations, make sure that the packages being used are not deprecated, and confirm that AI's ideas follow best practices through searching on google for advice or comparing with similar projects to compare the approaches and find holes in the one generated by AI.

When it comes to researching, it is best to ask AI to provide sources and check them myself. Sometimes, those sources turn out to be nonexistent, or misinterpreted by AI.
## Reflection

**When should you use AI for assistance, and when should you rely on your own skills?**

I can use AI to do tedious tasks like writing boilerplate code or looking for minor syntax errors, but I should not rely on it to develop an entire program for me from beginning to end. It should only be used as an assistant once in a while when I get stuck in a problem that I end up taking too long to find the solution to through the internet or by myself. AI should be used as a guide, not as a second developer.

**How can you avoid over-reliance on AI while still benefiting from it?**

Use AI with the mindset of treating it as an assistant, not a replacement of my own thinking. If one takes joy in learning and improving their skills, then they will automatically realize how over-relying on AI will severely limit them. I personally only use AI when:

1. I am chasing a deadline that is edging very close
2. I am unsure about what to do and have been stuck in that state for 30 minutes; I use AI to help be find ideas in this case, and then dive deeper into those ideas via my own research using google

Googling is a much more profound approach to researching and finding answers, so I use that approach over AI whenever I have the luxury of time.

**What steps will you take to ensure data privacy when using AI tools?**

- Do not share confidential information such as passwords and credit card info or sensitive files 
- Only use AI tools approved by the company with compliance settings

## Task

**Identify one task you can improve using an AI tool, and try it out.**

I can use Claude Sonnet through copilot to generate boilerplate for path operation functions for the CRUD operations of a simple to-do list app.

**Review the AI-generated output critically—did it require editing or fact-checking?**

Although it was prompted to just generate boilerplate and not implement logic, it wrote the logic for the path operations as well, leaving me only with the task of connecting with the database. As the task was rather simple, no errors were spotted in the code. More testing was carried out with Postman, and the endpoints worked as expected.

However, the way the code was set up by AI was not very beginner-friendly, and it took a little bit of tinkering to figure out how to start the webserver with the way the folder was structured. This was due to me using Flask, a framework that I am still new to. If I was to generate some more advanced features with AI at my current level of knowledge, I can end up in a lot of confusion when needing to debug or modify the code. 

**Document one best practice you will follow when using AI tools at Focus Bear.**

When working with tools, frameworks, or libraries that I am not entirely familiar with, such as Nest.js, I will minimise my use of AI to just auto-completing my lines as I type them out, especially when my schedule gets tight, or resolving confusing error messages (after confirmation from online sources).
