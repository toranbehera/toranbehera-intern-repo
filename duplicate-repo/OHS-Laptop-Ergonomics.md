# Occupational Health & Safety (OHS) for Desk-Based Work

## Reflection

### What equipment changes can you make to improve your workspace setup? (e.g., using an external monitor, adjusting your chair, using a laptop stand)

I could use an external monitor that gives me more flexibility in terms of how high/low I position it. Using an external keyboard, mouse, and a swivel chair can also improve my setup by giving me more flexibility over how I position my body while working.

### What behavioural changes can you implement to improve posture and reduce strain? (e.g., sitting upright, taking regular breaks, adjusting screen height)

I can take breaks more regularly to move around and try to position my monitor in a way that I won't have to bend my neck as much. Premeditated stretching exercises during breaks would benefit me as well.

### How can you remind yourself to maintain good posture and take breaks throughout the day? (Hint: Use Focus Bear to schedule movement breaks!)

I can use Focus Bear to know when my focus session is over, and then make use of its 30 second break activities feature which includes exercises such as doing push-ups. 

## Task: Document at least one workspace change or habit adjustment you made.

Habit: I do neck stretching exercises and move around between my 25 minute focus sessions.

Workspace: I use an external keyboard now.
