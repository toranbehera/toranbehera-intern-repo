## How I Work Best

- I do my best work when:
	- I am getting to learn a lot of new things
	- I am given hard deadlines
	- I understand the importance of my task

- I struggle when:
	- There is a lot of noise 
	- I don't have anyone to turn to when I have doubts or questions 
	- I am not learning anything new from my work 

## Communication Style

- I prefer messages to be:
	- Casual, almost as if speaking to a friend, but on topic
	
- The best way to reach me is:
	- Through pinging me in Discord
	- Emailing me at toranbehera@gmail.com
	
- If you need something urgent, do this:
	- Call me on WhatsApp: +855 016 544 310

## Collaboration & Teamwork

- I work best in a team when:
	- I am trusted by my teammates with responsibilities 
	- I am given the chance to share my thoughts 
	- My teammates are honest about the quality of my work and suggest how I can improve
	
- My biggest pet peeve in teamwork is:
	- Being asked to do some work, but at the end have my contributions entirely replaced or made redundant without getting the opportunity to improve it through feedback
	
- If I seem quiet in a meeting, it usually means:
	- I am listening and taking a lot of notes
	- I do not feel that I have anything substantial to contribute at that moment
	- I feel scared about saying/asking something that might make people lose their trust in me

## Focus & Productivity

- I stay focused by:
	- Using a pomodoro timer: [pomofocus.io](https://pomofocus.io/)
	- Listening to non-distracting music
	- Drinking coffee
	
- Things that distract me:
	- Noise in public spaces; I always have headphones on
	- Messages from friends
	- Thinking about the future
	- Interesting Youtube videos or Instagram posts

- The best way to support my productivity is:
	- Giving me hard (but generous :)) deadlines
	- Explaining the requirements to me as clearly as possible 
	- Allowing me to ask questions

## Feedback & Growth

- I like feedback to be:
	- Direct but polite
	- Given with examples of how I could improve

- When I make a mistake, the best way to let me know is:
	- By sending me a message or informing me verbally in a meeting
	
- I appreciate it when teammates:
	- Trust me with responsibilities
	- suggest ways how I could improve my work respectfully

## Fun Facts & Quirks

- One thing people often misunderstand about me is:
	- I am not interested in getting to know them; I am happy to chat and make new friends, I just feel like its appropriate to keep the topics related to work while I am working :) 
	
- A fun fact about me:
	- In order to sleep like a baby before midnight, I need to walk 20,000 steps and have a banana at least an hour and half before bed
	
- My work superpower is:
	- I thoroughly enjoy software development and can stay focused on related work for long periods of time
