## Reflection

**What security measures do you currently follow, and where can you improve?**

Currently, I:
- have 3 strong passwords that I use across different accounts
- have two factor authentication enabled, especially with face ID
- refrain from creating accounts in shady websites
- refrain from scanning QR codes on vague flyers randomly distributed across campus as research from Swinburne has revealed that they could pose security threats

I could improve by:
- having more variety in my passwords
- using a password manager like bitwarden to securely store and generate strong passwords
- regularly updating passwords, especially critical accounts, e.g. banking, email, university login
- avoiding password reuse across different platforms
- setting up backup 2FA methods in case face ID/phone access fails
- revoking access from apps/services that I no longer use
- backing up important data in secure cloud storage options or an external hard drive

**How can you make secure behaviour a habit rather than an afterthought?**

I can do this by:
- Using a password manager so I don’t rely on memory and can quickly generate secure passwords
- Practicing the 'think before you click' principle with links, attachments, and QR code until it becomes second nature to me
- Acknowledging the critical nature of secure behaviour
- Drafting the aforementioned tasks from the previous question and using the Focus Bear app's to do list feature to remind me to complete them every day

**What steps will you take to ensure your passwords and accounts are secure?**

- Create unique, strong passwords for each account using a password manager
- Enable two-factor authentication, preferably via an authenticator app rather than SMS
- Regularly review and update my most important account passwords
- Avoid using personal information like birthdays or names in passwords
- Monitor accounts for unusual login alerts and act immediately if notified

**What would you do if you suspected a security breach or suspicious activity on your account?**

- Immediately change the password for the affected account 
- Revoke any suspicious sessions or devices logged into the account
- Check recent activity logs for unusual access locations
- Enable or reset two-factor authentication to lock out intruders
- Reach out to the service provider (e.g., university IT support, bank, email provider) for assistance
- Run a virus scan on my devices
