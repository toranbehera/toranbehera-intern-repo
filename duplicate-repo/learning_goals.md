**What do you hope to learn from this internship?**

I hope to become more familiar with frameworks and libraries like React Native, Redux, Nest.js and Jest, which are essential to developing apps, as well as tools such as git and github; mainly technical skills. Moreover, I also want to become better acquainted with the Agile framework of project management and become a better team player as a whole.

**What skills are you most excited to develop?**

Technical skills, as I previously described, particularly Redux for global state management and Nest js for backend development. I also want to understand git workflow better and learn how to use git rebase, resolve conflicts and merge pull requests.

**What do you think you can contribute to the team?**

I already have been learning full stack dev with react, fastapi, postgresql, and some other libraries for a few months now and can use these tools (particularly react) at an intermediate level, so this familiarity means that I can carry out work to a good level. I also have made a lot of user flow diagrams lately for side projects and my ability in UX has been commended by teachers, so I am capable of not only implementing features, but also suggest/implementing improvements to current ones. 

**What is one area you feel less confident in that youâ€™d like to improve?**

I want to get more comfortable at frontend development with typescript, as I have been very dependent on type coercion in javascript and python lately, as well as using global state management libraries. I am also still a beginner to backend development, so I am keen on dabbling with Nest js to develop APIs or create new ones.

**What does success in this internship look like for you?**

By the end of the internship, I want to feel like I have learned more than I have expected myself to learn, especially to the point where I feel job-ready. I want to confidently be able to call myself a full-fledged software developer by the end of this internship, having acquired all the necessary technical skills and knowledge; that is what I consider as success in this internship.
