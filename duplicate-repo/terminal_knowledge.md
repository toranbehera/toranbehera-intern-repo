## Which terminal client did you choose? Why?
I chose PowerShell, but I also use WSL sometimes when I am using tools like docker which are natively supported on Linux. Additionally, I enjoy the less verbose commands in Linux, compared to those in PowerShell, which saves me from having to set up aliases. Managing packages is also very straightforward due to the convenient apt package manager in ubuntu. I also use tmux in Linux when I want to split my terminal into multiple screens, but  I am still yet to explore the more meaningful use cases of this package. Also, Linux's support for bash is also very handy, as it gives me even more flexibility over how I want to run my commands.

On the other hand, I use PowerShell when I have to interact with project that use packages and resources that are better supported in Windows, such as C# projects, mobile app projects, etc. Overall, using PowerShell for projects of this nature prevents any unnecessary complications.
## What customizations (if any) did you make?
All of my customizations were purely cosmetic. I made the terminal slightly transparent, changed the font to something that I liked, changed its background wallpaper so that fitted into the theme that my laptop wallpapers follow, and decreased the wallpaper's brightness so that the text that pops up in the terminal is more visible.

## What was the most useful command you learned today?
Grep is the most useful command that I have learned, as it lets me quickly search for certain words in any file or folder.
