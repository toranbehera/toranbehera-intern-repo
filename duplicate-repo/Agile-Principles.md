## Reflection

**What do you think are the biggest benefits and challenges of Agile?**

The biggest benefits of agile are:
- its flexibility, allowing plans to be modified dynamically during and between sprints
- iterative cycles of completing tasks, getting feedback, reflecting and then adapting to  improve the process for future sprints
- its more cohesive approach to collaborative work, requiring weekly meetings to share updates and planning deadlines to produce meaningful deliverables every sprint

The challenges of agile are:
- minimal documentation compared to traditional approaches such as the Waterfall method
- less rigid plan could lead to confusion in the team and result in unproductivity if priorities keep shifting and the scope of the project keep changing
- regular meetings could cause risk of feeling unproductive if ceremonies are poorly facilitated, but when done right they prevent bigger misalignments

**How can Agile principles help improve your role and responsibilities?**

Agile can improve my role and responsibilities by:
- Encouraging me to complete and deliver something meaningful periodically
- Simplifying my work by capping my workload to a specific number of tasks at most per sprint
- Promoting regular conversation with other members to validate my progress and other ideas so that requirements are captured more effectively
## Task

**Summarize the main differences between Scrum and Kanban in your own words.**

The main differences between scrum and kanban are:
- Scrum has fixed, defined roles, while team responsibilities are flexible in kanban
- Scrum involves fixed periods of work called sprints, whereas there is no such structure in Kanban and work flows continuously
- Scrum focuses on holding out regular meetings called ceremonies to share progress and plan, while Kanban focuses on visualising the workflow in a shared board 

Both scrum and kanban can be used together in a project.

**Identify one Agile principle you think will be most useful in your work.**

*Business and technical people work together daily.*

This principle is most useful in my work because it ensures **continuous collaboration** between developers and business stakeholders. Regular interaction not only gives me feedback on my progress but also allows me to suggest improvements and clarify requirements quickly. In app development, this collaboration helps confirm that the client’s needs are accurately understood and met, while also enabling the team to adapt plans effectively as new insights are gained.
