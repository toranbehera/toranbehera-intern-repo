## Reflection

**Have you ever experienced or witnessed great teamwork and professionalism? What made it effective?**

Yes, I have witnessed great teamwork and professionalism during my time in the student council at school. There was an incident where our class grew upset with the student council president after changes were made to a highly anticipated school event. Instead of clarifying the reasons, many students spread rumours and criticized his character.

Our class representative, however, chose a different approach. He gathered the concerns and raised them in a council meeting. The student council then addressed the issue openly in front of the supervisor. It turned out the changes were mandated by the supervisor in response to students' parents' concerns, and the president himself had actually opposed them.

What impressed me was how the president handled the situation. Despite being wrongly accused, he remained calm, avoided placing blame, and even protected other council members from criticism. This professionalism, combined with the representative's constructive communication, helped rebuild trust between the students and the council.

I learned that effective teamwork comes from open communication, respect, and a focus on resolution rather than blame.

**What steps can you take to make sure your communication is clear, respectful, and inclusive?**

The first step is to always to think before speaking, even if it requires a brief pause. It is important to make sure that the words being said or the ideas being conveyed do not discomfort anyone in the team. Moreover, it is important to convey ideas, especially really technical ones, in a simple manner, without too many jargons. It is also important to pause and ask everyone questions once in a while to make sure that everyone gets an opportunity to share their ideas and thought or just make sure that everyone is keeping up with the discussion without feeling like they have lost me at some point.

**How can you help create a positive, fun, and professional work environment?**

I believe creating a positive, fun, and professional work environment starts with setting the tone through my own behavior. I make sure to stay focused on my responsibilities and communicate in a professional manner. At the same time, I keep interactions relaxed and approachable, so colleagues feel comfortable around me.

I'm mindful of respecting others' boundaries and avoid making anyone feel pressured or uncomfortable. I also try to contribute to a positive atmosphere by showing appreciation, expressing gratitude, and offering support to teammates when they face challenges. By combining professionalism with friendliness and respect, I can help foster a workplace that is both enjoyable and productive.

**How can you prepare effectively for meetings with supervisors and colleagues?**

I prepare by arranging any important points (questions, doubts, issues, problems, or anything important) in a notebook so that I can communicate them in the meeting. I personally like to map my thoughts and ideas as flowcharts in a notebook or a platform like figma so that I can explain them more effectively in the meeting (e.g. when  I am suggesting a new feature, exploring flaws in the current design, or discussing improvements to the current architecture). It is also important to research about the topics that are frequently discussed in meetings so that I do not end up asking questions to which the answers should be fairly obvious.

**What would it look like to be proactive during your internship?**

Giving regular updates to my supervisor at least once a week instead of waiting to be asked. If I am confused regarding what my tasks are or how I can approach them, I should search online or use ChatGPT for help. If I still find myself stuck after 30 minutes, I should reach out to my teammates first and then supervisor if needed for clarity or help.

**How might you follow up with colleagues or supervisors if you need information/action from them? How would you escalate it further if you don't get a response and when would you escalate?**

For general communications where I can expect delays up to 48 hours, e.g. asking for feedback on something, I should reach out via email. If I need a quicker response within 24 hours, I should reach out via Discord or Teams. If the matter is urgent, then I should reach out via SMS and expect a response within 2 hours. If it is an emergency and I need an immediate response, I should call, e.g. when I am locked out of the office without internet.

**What are some things you won't do?**

I should not sit idly waiting for instructions. Instead, I should take initiative and find ways to make meaningful contributions. If I am unsure, I should ask a teammate. 

I should come to meetings prepared, as in reading the brief, keeping track of my progress, and bringing questions or blockers.

I should also take notes during meetigns so that I don't find myself asking the same questions again and again in future meetings. 

I should avoid asking questions to which I can find the answer to convenienty via Google or ChatGPT.

I should also not ghost the project; I should provide updates routinely.

If I need a faster reply, I shouldn't rely solely on one mode of communication. If an email is taking too long, I should reach out via Discord.

I should not send out calendar invites with vague titles like 'client meeting', as it can cause confusions in an environment that involved multiple teams.
