**Which extensions did you install? Why?**

I installed:
- React Developer tools because
	- it helps me inspect each and every component and view the states of all variables inside each of them conveniently while debugging
	- it helps me gauge the performance of each component that's rendered so that I can identify bottlenecks in my application

- Redux DevTools because
- JSON Viewer Pro because
- Lighthouse because
	- It lets me benchmark test my app and gives me all sorts of data visualisations to monitor and gauge the performance of my app.
